# Chayva â€“ Capstone Project

## ðŸš€ Project Idea
Chayva is a Editting software application that allows creating, editing, and deleting users with an intuitive interface.

## ðŸ§  Brief Description
This full-stack app uses NEXT JS and Convex for the backend and React for the frontend. It includes CRUD functionality, user roles, and real-time updates.

## ðŸ“… Day-by-Day Plan
- Day 1: Set up GitHub repo, create README
- Day 2: Backend setup with convex
- Day 3: REST API for User operations
- Day 4: Frontend UI with NEXT JS
- Day 5: Connect frontend with backend
- Day 6: Testing & bug fixing
- Day 7: Final video, polish, and submission

## ðŸš€ Deployment Details

- **Backend:** Hosted on Convex (serverless platform)
  - [Convex Dashboard â€“ Designs Table](https://dashboard.convex.dev/t/atchay/chayva-2f8b9/wry-capybara-940/data?table=designs)

In order to run backend I use command "npx convex dev"

The backend schema and related files for this project currently reside in a separate repository: https://github.com/AtchayRM/Chayva-Capstone.git
All schema definitions (including the Convex schema.js file) and backend logic are implemented there.
These backend files will be merged into the main capstone repository before final submission to keep everything consolidated.
