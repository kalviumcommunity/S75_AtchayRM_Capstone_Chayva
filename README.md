*** Capstone Project: Chayva(Designing app) ***

# Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a web-based customisable design board, offering an interactive platform for users to design and edit content. Users will have access to features like painting, adding stickers, drawing, adjusting frame sizes, and downloading their creations. The platform will support both user-uploaded assets and a pre-existing library of design elements.
